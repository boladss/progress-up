# Progress-Up
 
 **Progress-Up** is a mobile application designed to elevate your fitness journey using pose estimation technology. It tracks your form as you perform a variety of push-up progressions—incline, knee, standard, and more—and delivers instant, actionable feedback such as *"straighten your back"* or *"try and go lower"*. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned calisthenics enthusiast, Progress-Up can help you build strength with precision and confidence.

## Background
This is the working repository for the undergraduate research study entitled **"Progress-Up: Development of a mobile application utilizing 2D pose estimation to provide real-time feedback for push-up progressions"** from the Service Science and Software Engineering Laboratory (S3) of the Department of Computer Science in the University of the Philippines Diliman.
